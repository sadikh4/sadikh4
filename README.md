## Hi, I'm Sadikh

B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering student focused on
embedded systems, hardware prototyping, and assistive electronics.

I enjoy working close to hardware — designing, debugging, and improving
real-world systems rather than just simulations.

### Technical Skills
- Embedded C / C++
- Microcontrollers: ESP32, STM32, Arduino
- Sensors & Actuators
- Embedded hardware debugging
- Basic signal processing concepts

### Key Projects
- **Tongue-Controlled Wheelchair (Oralink)**  
  Assistive mobility system using capacitive sensing and embedded control.

- **Smart Shoe for Health Monitoring**  
  HR & SpO₂ monitoring with alerts and energy harvesting concepts.

- **Water Quality Monitoring System**  
  pH, TDS, and turbidity measurement using embedded sensors.

### Current Interests
- Embedded & real-time systems
- RF and signal processing (learning stage)
- Assistive & medical electronics
